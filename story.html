<br>Hey!</br>
<br>This is Gus, Gus the Turtle!</br>
<br>Do you wanna hear the story of how Gus got here?</br>
<br>It all started when his mom laid eggs in the sand.</br>
<br>About 70 days later, Gus and his 100 other siblings hatched.</br>
<br>They all went straight for the water, but there was one threat, a BIG one.</br> 
<br>Over them there were seagulls, many, there were at least enough to kill all of them.</br>
<br>But Gus wasn't scared at all. </br>
<br>He ran faster than any turtle has ever ran before. </br>
<br>He ran, and he ran all the way until he was in the ocean.</br> 
<br>Unfortunately, not all of his siblings made it to the ocean before the seagulls got them.</br> 
<br>When Gus got older he got injured. </br>
<br>That's when I found him, and adopted him. </br>
<br>That was five years ago.</br>
<br>But now, I am going on vacation to Bali.</br>
<br>I would love to bring Gus, but there are too many seagulls.</br>
<br>So could you please watch him for me while I go on vacation?</br>

<br>Remember to wash him by clicking the wash button.</br>
<br>Then you can feed him so heâ€™s nice and full.</br>
<br>At last, you can put him to sleep. </br>
