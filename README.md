This adorable turtle needs petsitting while his owner has gone on vacation, and you're the lucky sitter! The game is simple. Click the **washbutton** to clean off the filthy dirt on his body. When Gus is nice and clean, click the **feedbutton** to fill his empty stomach. After this, Gus will want to go to sleep with the **sleepbutton**.

**The game uses three programming languages:**
